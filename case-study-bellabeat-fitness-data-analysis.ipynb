Sedentary individuals require fewer calories, while active individuals need more to sustain their energy levels.\n- When comparing the four activity levels to calorie expenditure, most data clusters around users burning 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day. Notably, the sedentary trend flattens towards the higher end, while the fairly and very active trend curves upwards. This suggests that users who burn more calories tend to spend less time being sedentary and more time engaging in fairly to very active pursuits.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 2.4.7.4 Assumption 4 : Total Minutes Asleep vs Calories","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plot chart for total minutes asleep vs calories\nggplot(data=merged_data, aes(x=totalminutesasleep, y = calories, color=totalminutesasleep))+ \n  geom_point()+ \n  labs(title=\"Total Minutes Asleep vs Calories\")+\n  xlab(\"Total Minutes Alseep\")+\n  stat_smooth(method=lm)+\n  scale_color_gradient(low=\"orange\", high=\"purple\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-23T02:54:08.307109Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-23T02:54:08.309371Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-23T02:54:11.355360Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-23T02:54:11.353073Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Findings From Total Minutes Asleep vs Calories***\n- The data visualization shows no clear positive or negative correlation between total sleep minutes and calories burned.

It is advisable to have a larger sample size with complete records for a more thorough analysis.\n- Our participants predominantly fall into a category of low health status, commonly characterized by issues such as insomnia, prolonged sedentary behavior, and obesity.sers\n- To ensure a more accurate analysis, it's important to gather additional data by encouraging users to use WiFi connected scales instead of manually entering their weight. It is strongly advocate for automating all reporting methods. This change would streamline the app’s features, offering users a more seamless experience while reducing confusion.\n- Based on the available dataset, some data overlaps within datasets. Merging these overlapping features into one dataset is highly recommended to enhance health monitoring for users and improve the app's usability, ultimately boosting user engagem\n- The campaign can be enhanced with a points-based incentive system, where users who complete weekly exercise goals or participate in specific challenges will earn Bellabeat points, redeemable for products or membership rewards.\n- Bellabeat health trackers could incorporate a vibration reminder after extended periods of inactivity, prompting users to move.
